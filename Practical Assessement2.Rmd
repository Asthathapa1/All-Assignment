### PART 2

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```


```{r}

thanks_meal<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-11-20/thanksgiving_meals.csv")

```



```{r}
###1.Display the first 10 rows of the dataset using RMarkdown (1 marks)
thanks_meal%>%head(10)%>% kable
```

```{r}
###2. Use `fct_reorder` and `parse_number` functions to create a factor variable `family_income`
family_income<- thanks_meal %>%
       mutate(family_income = fct_reorder(family_income, parse_number(family_income)))

```



```{r}
###3. Generate the general statistics of the dataset using `summary()` and `skim()` function (2 mark).
library(skimr)
skim(thanks_meal)
summary(thanks_meal)
```

```{r}
###4.What is the number of people who celebrate?
###Ans. 980 is the number of people who celebrate
thanks_meal%>%
  count(celebrate, sort = TRUE) %>%filter(celebrate =="Yes")%>%
  kable()
```



```{r}
##5. What are categories and stats for each main dish served and the method it is prepared?
thanks_meal%>%
  count(main_dish, main_prep, sort = TRUE) %>%
  kable()
```


```{r}
###6. Create a data viz showing this in the most evident way. Provide your own legend and use themes.
thanks_meal%>%
  count(main_dish, main_prep, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(main_dish, n, fill=main_prep))+
  geom_col()+ facet_wrap(main_prep~.)+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()+
  labs(x="Types of Main Dish",y= "Item Numbers", title="Different Main Dish", caption="Data Visualisation graph") + theme_linedraw()
```

```{r}
###How many use cranberry sauce? How many use gravy?
  ###Total 803 used cranberry sauce and 892 used gravy 
 thanks_meal%>%count(cranberry, sort = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%kable()

 thanks_meal%>%count(gravy, sort = TRUE)%>%filter(gravy =="Yes") %>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%kable()
 
 
 thanks_meal%>%count(cranberry,gravy, sort = TRUE) %>%filter(gravy =="Yes")%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%kable() ## showing the number of people using gravy along with cranberry sauce
```

```{r fig.width = 20}

### 8.  What is the distribution of those who celebrate across income ranges
thanks_meal%>%count(celebrate,family_income, sort = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%kable()
```


```{r}
###9. Present this information in the most evident way on the data viz.
thanks_meal%>%
count(celebrate,family_income, sort=TRUE)%>%filter(celebrate=="Yes")%>% ggplot(aes(family_income,n,fill=celebrate))+
  facet_wrap(celebrate~.)+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()+
  geom_text(aes(label = round(n, digits = 2)),vjust =-0.2, color="pink") +
  labs(x="income range ", y=" " , title="Distribution of people who celebrate per across income range" , caption = "Data visualization")
```



```{r}
### 10.  What are the most common pies, sides, and desserts?

common<-thanks_meal %>%
  select(id, starts_with("side"),
         starts_with("pie"),
         starts_with("dessert")) %>%
  select(-side15, -pie13, -dessert12) %>%
  gather(type, value, -id) %>%
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE)%>%
  filter(!is.na(value),
         !value %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)")) %>%
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+"))
common%>% head(20)

```


```{r}
###11. Present this information on a data viz)

common%>% group_by(type)%>% mutate(mostcommons=fct_reorder(value,n))%>%ungroup()%>%
 ggplot(aes(mostcommons,n,fill=type))+
  facet_wrap(type~.)+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_col()+
  geom_text(aes(label=n),vjust=0.2, size=2, colour="pink")+
  labs(x="Name of food", y="Frequecy of those food", title="", caption = "Distribution of Common type of dessert,pie and side served in Thanks giving ")
  
```








```{r fig.width = 16}
###13How do the servings differ by income?
###With the increase in income the serving for turkey dish have increased but overall there is not much change in main dish serving in comparison to income.



## 14.Present this information on a data viz


thanks_meal%>% filter(main_dish!="None", main_dish!="other(please specify)")%>% count(main_dish, family_income) %>% ggplot(aes(main_dish, n, fill=family_income))+geom_col()+
  facet_wrap(family_income~.)+ coord_flip()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(n, digits=1)), vjust=-0.5, size=4, color="black")+ theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x="Dish Type", y="Frequency of dish prepared", title="Most common ways served meal according to income during thanks giving",caption ="Data visualisation through graph" )
